Each homework assignment is a comprehensive package that includes detailed requirements, implementation instructions, code samples, and supplementary image files._
  
## [Homework 1](https://github.com/AndriciucAndreeaCristina/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/RGB_LED_h1)
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.  
I have used a different potentiometer to control each color of the RGB Led, reading the potentiometer value with Arduino and then mapping it to specifin intensities to the LED pins.

## Homework 2
This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs and buttons.

## Homework 3
Using the joystick, one can control the position of the segments of a seven segment display and "draw" on the display. The initial position is on the DP. The current
position always blinks (irrespective of the fact that the segment is on or off), using the joystick to move from one position to neighbors. Short pressing the button toggles the segment state from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. Long pressing the button resets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving the
current position to the decimal point.
