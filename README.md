_Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest (2023-2024).
Each homework assignment is a comprehensive package that includes detailed requirements, implementation instructions, code samples, and supplementary image files._
  
## [Homework 1](https://github.com/AndriciucAndreeaCristina/IntroductionToRobotics/tree/main/RGB_LED_h1)
This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue) of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.  
I have used a different potentiometer to control each color of the RGB Led, reading the potentiometer value with Arduino and then mapping it to specifin intensities to the LED pins.
